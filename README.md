## What is this?

Timezoner - a chrome/firefox extension that automatically converts the times on websites to your local timeozone.

## Why?

Coz the timezones are a pain. And opening a new tab just to convert everytime is even more of a pain.

## How to use?

1. Install the extension from [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/timezoner/kilojkiejkaaepjepjbkengfhdnlamne) for chrome or from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-timezoner/) for firefox.
2. And that's it. Everytime you visit a page that has a time in a different timezone than your own, the extension will convert the time to your local timezone and display it beside the oroginal.

## Disclaimer

Timezones are tricky and working with timezones is a pain.... and complicated (as I've realized while building this). And because of that, it's not guaranteed the extension will work every single time. After all, there are numerous ways to specify a time with timezone. But, constant development is in progress to account for as many cases as possible. So, in case you come across any formats the extension is not working with, you can open an issue here or reach out on discord support server.

## Issues

For any issues, either with the extension not working with particular formats or just extension not working as expected, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/thevenuz/timezoner/issues).
